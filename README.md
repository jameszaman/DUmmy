# DUmmy

This is the repo where all my practice files are going to be kept. I usually write some helpful functions/modules when practicing and they get removed or stays in 1 hard drive which gets annoying. This is to save those helpful functions.


## Folder Structure.

This is an example structure. It is not mandatory or recommended to follow the exact name, but it is mandatory to follow this structure.

```
